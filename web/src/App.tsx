/* THE POSTER, in one paragraph.
 *
 * The page breaks its own lines. Words are placed on a character grid and each
 * one is positioned absolutely at the cell it landed in, because the cell a word
 * lands in then depends only on the words between it and the mirror — so a
 * longer draft re-uses every position the shorter one had, and the text grows
 * outward at its two edges instead of reflowing. Letting the browser wrap
 * instead would have been fine for a finished palindrome and useless for one
 * still being written: the search grows the left half by PREPENDING, and
 * prepending into a flowing paragraph moves every word after it. The font is
 * monospace, so a cell is a fixed size and none of this needs measuring, beyond
 * one reading of the character advance at startup.
 *
 * The camera falls out of the same grid rather than being a mechanism of its
 * own. The mirror sits at a fixed cell — column c0, the middle of row 0 — and
 * the block is translated by exactly that point and scaled about it, so the
 * caret is nailed to the centre of the screen for the whole run and the scale is
 * the only thing that ever changes. An earlier version pinned the block by its
 * own bounding centre, which drifts off the mirror as the two halves take
 * different numbers of lines.
 *
 * Nothing sets will-change. Promoting the block to its own layer made the
 * browser rasterise it whole; at the starting scale that is far past the
 * maximum texture size, and the failed raster was the black/white flicker.
